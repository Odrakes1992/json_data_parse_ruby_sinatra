### Instructions

Build a program that accepts two inputs:

- A JSON array of talent, containing objects with `name`, `location` and `date_of_birth` attributes
- A location to filter by

The program should then filter the array of supplied talent, and output the names of talent whose location matches the location supplied. The supplied location should be considered case-insensitive, and the order in which names are outputted is not important.

### Application

- clone repository
- brew install ruby gems
- run ruby app.rb from the command line
- sinatra web app will open
- to run unit tests run rspec from command line in root folder
